## Abstract 
Ever since research into the large-scale structure of our Universe began, numerous images of the striking appearance of the galactic 'cosmic web' have been created. However, 2D projections of the cosmic web do not do its true 3D structure justice, leading to attempts to characterize its elements in 3D space. The objective of this research is to create an accurate 3D-printed representation of the cosmic web of galaxies in our known universe, providing insights into the large-scale distribution of matter and helping constrain theoretical models for the evolution of structure in the Universe. Galaxy location data is collected from multiple online astronomy databases and plotted in 3D space. Although the data to be plotted is known, no robust 3D representation of the data yet exists. Generating a 3D-printable version of this data will allow anyone to explore it and hopefully lead to the discovery of previously unknown structures. A 3D plot of the data also allows for comparison with 3D computational simulations of the cosmic web, which will help in refining theoretical models of the evolution of the Universe. 

In order to conduct this project, I wrote a script in Matlab to parse and clean data related to galaxy locations in 3D space. From there, I used Matlab to convert the coordinates from the galactic coordinate system to the Cartesian coordinate system, and then plot the galaxies in a 3D graph. 

## Research Questions
- What coordinate system is used for galaxy positions?
- Why should galactic redshift be taken into account?
- Which modern catalogs of galaxies should be used?
- What is the best way to 3D plot so many galaxies?
- How can a 3D mesh of coordinates be transformed into an accurate 3D printable model?
- What is the best way to 3D print the model?

## Project Activities and Findings

- Collected galaxy location data from NASA Extragalactic Database (NED) and LV Galaxies (LVG) catalogs
- Used data analysis tools in Excel to organize galactic coordinates and convert to decimal numbers
- Utilized data visualization software to create 3D representation
